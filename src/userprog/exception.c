   1. Locate the page that faulted in the supplemental page table. If the memory reference is
   valid, use the supplemental page table entry to locate the data that goes in the page, which
   might be in the file system, or in a swap slot, or it might simply be an all-zero page. When
   you implement sharing, the page’s data might even already be in a page frame, but not in
   the page table.
   If the supplemental page table indicates that the user process should not expect any data
   at the address it was trying to access, or if the page lies within kernel virtual memory, or if
   the access is an attempt to write to a read-only page, then the access is invalid. Any invalid
   access terminates the process and thereby frees all of its resources.
   
   2. Obtain a frame to store the page. See Section 5.1.5 [Managing the Frame Table], page 44,
   for details.
   When you implement sharing, the data you need may already be in a frame, in which case
   you must be able to locate that frame.
   
   3. Fetch the data into the frame, by reading it from the file system or swap, zeroing it, etc.
   When you implement sharing, the page you need may already be in a frame, in which case
   no action is necessary in this step.
   
   4. Point the page table entry for the faulting virtual address to the frame. You can use the
   functions in ‘userprog/pagedir.c’. */
